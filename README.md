# ActiveRecord Model Rails Lab

## Objectives

1. Create a migration by hand
2. Create a model by hand
3. Build a model instance method

## Building a Model

You can find the test suite for this application in the `spec/models` directory and run them with the command: `bundle exec rspec`. This lab tests to ensure that your app can create records and that it has an instance method that can be called on the model.

## Instructions

* Create a table by hand named `students` that has the columns: `first_name` and `last_name` â€“ this should be accomplished by creating a new database migration
* Create a model for the students' table that inherits from ActiveRecord::Base
* Implement a `to_s` instance method in the model that will return the concatenated first and last names for students. For example: `first_name: "Daenerys", last_name: "Targaryen" => "Daenerys Targaryen"`
